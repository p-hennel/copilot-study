# Socket Database Manager Refactoring

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring of the socket database manager to integrate seamlessly with the existing Drizzle ORM infrastructure.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Created Socket Schema (`schema/socket-schema.ts`)

Moved all socket-specific table definitions from the database manager to a proper Drizzle schema file:

- **`socketConnection`**: Tracks active WebSocket connections from crawlers
- **`jobQueue`**: Manages job assignments between web app and crawlers  
- **`jobAssignmentMapping`**: Maps web app jobs to crawler jobs
- **`jobErrorLog`**: Logs and tracks job failures for debugging

**Key Features:**
- Proper Drizzle schema definitions with type inference
- Foreign key relationships to existing `job` table
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- Follows established naming conventions from `base-schema.ts`

### 2. Refactored Database Manager (`database-manager.ts`)

Completely refactored to use existing database infrastructure:

**Before:**
- Custom SQLite connection management
- Manual SQL execution
- Custom transaction handling
- Separate database instance

**After:**
- Uses shared database connection from `$lib/server/db`
- Pure Drizzle ORM query builders
- Integrated transaction handling
- Follows established patterns from the codebase

### 3. Integration Improvements

**Database Connection:**
- Removed custom `Database` and `drizzle` instances
- Uses `getDb()` from existing infrastructure
- Leverages existing connection pooling and configuration
- Proper foreign key constraint handling

**Type Safety:**
- Full TypeScript type inference with Drizzle
- Uses `$inferSelect` and `$inferInsert` patterns
- Consistent with existing schema type exports
- Proper error handling throughout

**Schema Management:**
- Socket schema exported from main schema file
- Integrated with existing migration system
- Compatible with `drizzle.config.ts`
- Follows established directory structure

### 4. Database Operations Refactoring

**Replaced Raw SQL with Drizzle:**
```typescript
// Before: Manual SQL
this.sqlite!.exec(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS...`);

// After: Drizzle schema definitions
export const socketConnection = sqliteTable(...)
```

**Improved Query Patterns:**
```typescript
// Before: Raw SQL with manual type handling
const result = await db.run('INSERT INTO...');

// After: Type-safe Drizzle operations
const [created] = await db.insert(socketConnection)
  .values(data)
  .returning();
```

**Enhanced Transaction Handling:**
```typescript
// Before: Custom transaction management
await this.withRetry(async () => { ... });

// After: Drizzle's built-in transactions
await this.withTransaction(async (tx) => { ... });
```

### 5. Performance and Reliability

**Connection Management:**
- Single shared database connection
- No connection pooling overhead
- Proper connection lifecycle management
- Health checks using existing patterns

**Query Optimization:**
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Efficient bulk operations with Drizzle
- Optimized aggregation queries
- Proper use of foreign key constraints

**Error Handling:**
- Consistent error logging patterns
- Proper transaction rollback
- libsql-compatible result handling (`.rowsAffected` vs `.changes`)
- Type-safe error propagation

### 6. Code Organization

**Schema Structure:**
```
schema/
├── base-schema.ts       # Core job and area tables
├── auth-schema.ts       # Authentication tables  
├── socket-schema.ts     # Socket-specific tables (NEW)
└── schema.ts           # Exports all schemas
```

**Database Operations:**
- `SocketDatabaseOperationsImpl`: Core CRUD operations
- `ConnectionStateOperationsImpl`: Connection tracking
- `JobQueueOperationsImpl`: Queue management
- All using proper Drizzle patterns

### 7. Compatibility and Integration

**Existing Code Compatibility:**
- All existing interfaces maintained
- Same public API surface
- Drop-in replacement for previous implementation
- No breaking changes to consumers

**Infrastructure Integration:**
- Uses same database instance as rest of application
- Integrates with existing logging (`@logtape/logtape`)
- Compatible with existing settings and configuration
- Follows established error handling patterns

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { DatabaseManager } from './database-manager';

// Create manager (uses shared DB connection)
const dbManager = new DatabaseManager();

// Get operations interfaces
const dbOps = dbManager.createDatabaseOperations();
const connOps = dbManager.createConnectionStateOperations();
const queueOps = dbManager.createJobQueueOperations();

// All operations use proper Drizzle ORM
const job = await dbOps.createJobFromAssignment(assignment);
const progress = await dbOps.getJobProgress(jobId);
await dbOps.logJobError(jobId, error);
```

## Migration Notes

**No Database Migration Required:**
- Socket tables are created automatically on first use
- Existing job and area tables remain unchanged
- Foreign key relationships properly established
- Backward compatible with existing data

**Deployment Considerations:**
- Single shared database connection improves resource usage
- Better error handling and logging
- Enhanced performance through proper indexing
- More reliable transaction handling

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Proper Drizzle Integration**: Uses established ORM patterns throughout
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Leverages existing database connection and configuration
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type inference and validation
4. **Performance**: Optimized queries and proper indexing
5. **Maintainability**: Follows established codebase patterns and conventions
6. **Reliability**: Better error handling and transaction management
7. **Consistency**: Unified database access patterns across the application

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `schema/socket-schema.ts` - Socket-specific Drizzle schema definitions
- `src/lib/server/socket/persistence/README.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `src/lib/server/socket/persistence/database-manager.ts` - Complete refactoring
- `schema/schema.ts` - Added socket schema export

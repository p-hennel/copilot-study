## Understanding AI's Impact on _YOUR_ Work

### What We're Studying

We're conducting research on how AI tools are changing the landscape of programming work. By understanding these changes, we can help shape better tools, workflows, and training for developers in the future—potentially including yourself and your team.

### How Data Collection Works

To gather meaningful insights beyond just surveys, we're collecting digital trace data through GitLab and Jira. This approach gives us a more accurate picture of real-world development practices than relying solely on self-reported information.

When you participate, you'll be directed to our secure self-service portal where you can:

1. Authorize read-only API access to your GitLab and Jira accounts
2. Review exactly what data we collect
3. Download and inspect your own data after collection

### Privacy and Data Protection Commitments

We take your privacy extremely seriously. Here's how we protect your information:

- **Read-only access**: We cannot modify any of your projects or data
- **Focus on patterns, not specifics**: We're not interested in your actual code or project content—only in workflow patterns and development practices
- **Automatic anonymization**: All names and email addresses are immediately hashed through a one-way process, making it impossible to identify individuals
- **Transparency**: You can download and review all data we've collected about you at any time

### Benefits of Participation

By contributing to this research, you'll:

- **Gain insights into your own work patterns** when you review your collected data
- **Help shape the future of developer tools** that you and your colleagues may use
- **Contribute to better understanding** of how AI is transforming software development
- **Receive early access to our findings and recommendations**, which may help you adapt more effectively to industry changes
- **Help ensure AI tools are developed to genuinely support developers** rather than replacing them

### We Welcome Your Questions

We want you to feel completely comfortable with this process. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions about our methodology, data usage, or privacy measures, please reach out to us any time.

Your participation is entirely voluntary, and we're committed to being responsive to any concerns you might have throughout the process.
